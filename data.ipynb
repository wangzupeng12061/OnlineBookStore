      "Title: Lit Chat, Authors: Book Riot, Publisher: ABRAMS, Keywords: ['Literary Criticism'], Content: Get the conversation started—at your book club, writer’s group, or any friendly get-together—with these 100 reading-themed questions. Some invoke books that are tied to memories (name your favorite childhood picture book); others prompt you to choose ideal reading material for a hypothetical situation (if you were stranded on a desert island, what book would you want with you?). Some of them aim to get people comparing their favorite (and not-so-favorite) characters or authors, and others engage in popular debates among readers (name a movie adaptation you liked and defend your choice). Created to give readers of all persuasions an excuse to talk about books, ideas, and life itself, this collection from the largest independent community for book lovers in North America is a delight for any bibliophile. Reading is a solitary experience—but being a reader is a shared experience, and that shared experience is what Lit Chat is all about., Price: 51.03, StockQuantity: 466, SeriesInfo: Statement pay onto poor resource., Cover: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YNA1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\n",
      "Title: Church Chat, Authors: Tom Smith, Publisher: iUniverse, Keywords: [], Content: On March 13, 2013, the Catholic Church changed dramatically when Pope Francis I, the Argentine slum walker, immediately began to redefine the papacy. His refreshing yet humble leadership collides with the approach of previous popes and revives the themes of the Second Vatican Council. In Church Chat, author Tom Smith catalogues that remarkable transition in an entertaining and thought provoking style. A collection of previously published columns dating from 2009 and into 2014, Church Chat fearlessly displays some flaws of the Catholic Church while applauding the leadership of Pope Francis. It is written by a progressive, and still practicing, Catholic who insists \"It's my Church, too!\" Transition times stir things up, cause unusual hopes and fears, bring stuff at the bottom to the top and take one set of priorities and replace them with another. Things move quickly during major transitions, what was standard at one time is replaced by a new approach. Since this new period is just beginning, we don't know how it will turn out, but one thing is certain: these are historic times in the Catholic Church. Pope Francis is moving quickly on many fronts and the vision of Vatican II is growing some flesh. Finally. \"Every Catholic -- liberal, conservative, or confused -- will benefit from Tom Smith's intelligent book Church Chat. I highly recommend this lively and loving book.\" -Michael Leach, author of Why Stay Catholic? Unexpected Answers to a Life-Changing Question \"Church Chat is a great read for veteran Church reformers as well as for people in the pews. The issue treatment is very comprehensive and right on... all done in a friendly conversational style. The reader thus comes away with a window into a hope filled near future for the People of God as well as a warm connection with Tom on his soulful journey forward.\" -Dan and Sheila Daley, Co-Founders of Call to Action, Price: 38.35, StockQuantity: 689, SeriesInfo: Environmental less plant student., Cover: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tMDwBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\n",

      "Title: FDR’s First Fireside Chat, Authors: Amos Kiewe, Publisher: Texas A&M University Press, Keywords: ['Political Science'], Content: “I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States.” Thus began not only the first of Franklin Roosevelt’s celebrated radio addresses, collectively called Fireside Chats, but also the birth of the media era of the rhetorical presidency. Humorist Will Rogers later said that the president took “such a dry subject as banking and made everyone understand it, even the bankers.” Roosevelt also took a giant step toward restoring confidence in the nation’s banks and, eventually, in its economy. Amos Kiewe tells the story of the First Fireside Chat, the context in which it was constructed, the events leading to the radio address, and the impact it had on the American people and the nation’s economy. Roosevelt told America, “The success of our whole national program depends, of course, on the cooperation of the public—on its intelligent support and its use of a reliable system.” Kiewe succinctly demonstrates how the rhetoric of the soon-to-be-famous First Fireside Chat laid the groundwork for that support and the recovery of American capitalism., Price: 95.48, StockQuantity: 843, SeriesInfo: Do choice state., Cover: http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Itc2YqY3_j4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\n",
